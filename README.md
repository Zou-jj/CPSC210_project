# A battle simulator

This app is a prototype of a battle simulation game

**Possible user**:
- *Gamers*
- *Game developers*
- *Scholars who want to run simulation*

The reason I am interested in making a battle simulator is that I played some really interesting flash games
with my friends when I was a child, and I am a huge fan of Lord of the Rings.
So I want to recall some of those precious memory and make an app to simulate some classic scenes
from the Lord of the Rings.
